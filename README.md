# Machine_Learning_ALS
This repository is intended to be used to store the implementation of code that is commonly used in machine learning, using python(3.6) + numpy, drawing with matplotlib.Sometimes may also use some third-party libraries for data processing, such as pandas, etc.

The implementation of these algorithms is mainly to deepen the understanding of machine learning. The structure and execution efficiency of the code may not be the best. Each algorithm's implementation code has two format(md, ipynb) of the text.

* [perceptron.ipynb](./perceptron.ipynb) | [perceptron.md](./perceptron.md)
* [Linear_Regressiong.ipynb](./Linear_Regression.ipynb) | [Linear Regression.md](./Linear_Regression.md) 
* [ID3_decision_tree.ipynb](./ID3_decision_tree.ipynb) | [ID3_decision_tree.md](./ID3_decision_tree.md)
* [naive_bayes.ipynb](./naive_bayes.ipynb) | [naive_bayes.md](./naive_bayes.md)
* [K-NN.inpynb](./KNN.ipynb) | [K-NN.md](./KNN.md)

The code will continue to be updated to fix the deficiency. If you have a better way of writing or have found my mistake, please let me know.
